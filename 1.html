    [Verse1]
    All the colours, and personalities
    You can't say what you are, what you mean
    You're hurting me, without noticing
    I'm so so boring
    someone just to love me</p>

    <p>[Pre-Chorus]
    I'm no invincible
    I have much memories of getting more weaker
    Know, I'm not lovable
    But you know what you have to say</p>

    <p><strong>
    [Chorus]
    Come on let's go to bed
    We gonna rock tonight away
    Connected to you babe
    If you're not in the right mood to sleep, now then
    Come on let's drink and have
    very unmanageable day
    Would you put me in babe
    If you're not in the right mood to sleep, now then
    Come take my heart and gold
    I'll be yours for sure</strong></p>

    <p>
    [Bridge]
    You're the only one who knows my yesterday
    The one who knows I'm here, alive to die
    *Can't forgive me, same out of mean to you
    You should know what you have to say!</p>
